<br><em>With a passion towards creativity and freedom, I have chose the path of a coder, whether that be software engineering, front-end, start-up, I am always excited to work. From leading a sports team as a captain, to cooperating with schools and other companies to increase outreach for a start-up company, I combine my passion for creativity and communication to further the impact that a coder will have within the company. I strive to create an impactful and admirable experience/application that resonates with its audiences.</em>
